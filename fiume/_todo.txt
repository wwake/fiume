* Remove use of name and birth year

* Delete streams
* Edit stream
* Move streams

Pools

Inflation

* Move to Plans with group vs [Plan] in various places - tree view requires MutableCollection

* Try List instead of OutlineGroup and see if we can avoid [Plan]? in Plan
* Maybe Possibilities should be a struct, regenerated as needed

* Require distinct people names

* Make amount an overrideable value on stream
* SS with 1/2 of spouse etc.

* Sections
* Move streams between sections - see https://chriswu.com/posts/swiftui/multiplelistmove/


* Allow dates to depend on death day

* Validate month is valid; end-date >= start-date

* Add multiple sections



Calendar view (with RuleMark)
Add assets/liabilities
Add flows
Should we segregate streams by income/expense? (two columns)

Variables?

* Do we need to use CodingKeys and implement encode/decode? (to eliminate warnings about unused ("$observationRegistrar") fields) - OK for now; if future updates change the fields, we need to accommodate that.

FI-24-27: 2024-07-02 - Plan Persistence

FI-24-23: 2024-06-18 - Plan Persistence - Try Again
* Make ContentView own [Plan] rather than Possibilities
* Re-add our delete all database button

* Made sure scenarios and groups work, even when deep
* Rename Planxty => Plan
* Persistence - Tried making Possiblities a model object, needed Plan to be one too [to allow recursion]
* Made other classes Decodable
* Tried to activate modelContainer without success

FI-24-19: 2024-06-11 - Persistence - PlanTree â‡’ enum
Persistence
* Convert PlanTree to Plan enum [parallel change] - and node

* Convert PlanTree to Planxty struct
* Update all sets of tests
* Need to decide which of the three representations will work for persistence

FI-24-18: 2024-06-10 - User Interface for the Ages
* [offline] Added environment(people) to previews that needed it.

* [offline] Rename project() to netWorth()
* Make AgeSelector work [it could only pick first name on list because selection state was optional]
* Make Person.birthYear required

Persistence
* Convert PlanTree to Plan enum [parallel change] - stream

FI-24-17: 2024-06-06 - Age-Based Dates

* Introduce abbreviated constants for MonthYear eg. 2024.oct
* Make Stream work for age on birthdates

FI-24-15: 2024-06-04 - MonthNumber => MonthYear
* Manage by month/year:
  * Make MonthYear be Strideable
  * Make Possibilities pass down MonthYear
  * Split out Month as a separate enum
  * Scenario.project() needs range over MonthYear
  * Make StreamView use Date picker

FI-24-14: 2024-06-03 - People
* [offline] Changed "Family" to "People"
* [offline] Added colors for dark mode
* [offline] Changed stream color to transparent when amount = 0
* Introduced update(using:) to DateSpecifier to simplify Stream
* Add start date to Possibilities
* Changed "DateDescription.unspecified" to "unchanged"

* Improve test naming
* Turn a plan with alternatives into a set of plans that don't use alternatives
  * Distinguish "and" nodes from "or" nodes
  * Build a concrete plan from a multi-scenario plan with "or" nodes
* Introduce ScenarioSet for Set<Scenario> arguments - might not need a set internally

FI-24-06: 2024-05-20 - Graphs & Combinatorics
* Bug in graph: Make sure net for stream only takes streams that are active that month (fixed PlanLeaf)
* Make Stream able to merge with identically-named streams [but not using it yet]
* Make Stream a struct

FI-24-03: 2024-05-14 - Edit Streams
* Did a spike for display and editing of tree
* Did a parallel change to support a new Plan2 that's an enum (rather than an array of Streams). This sets us up for AND/OR trees of streams (or other things).
* Started a parallel view change to display the plan as a tree
